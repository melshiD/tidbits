I've been fighting with SVG in that when I dynamically create elements to
describe animations and paths for the (also generated) planet shapes,
the browser does not regard the tags as having animating properties. 
The markup is apprearing in the elements tab of the dev tools, but
the shapes will not animate as they would if I had just had-coded the
tags.  Therefore, I'm going to 'template' the main skeleton in markup
and use JS to fill in values.  Hopefully this yields the result we need


Just concluded a two-day fight with getting clipping paths to work correctly when
generated with JS/ copied and attributes set.  Using setAttributeNS for
the clip path properties was keeping the path from being applied properly.
Using the un-namespaced setAttribute() alled me to apply the clipping paths
